### Details

This is a fork of Antony Corbett's OnlyR repository.  This project was updated to NET6 and there was some refactoring done.
I would consider this app experimental and would recommend people to download Antony Corbett's app for normal use.

### System Requirements

* Windows 10
* .NET 6 x86 or later
* 2GB RAM
* 15MB Hard disk space
* Audio recording device

### Download

If you just want to install the NET5 application, please download the [OnlyRSetup.exe](https://github.com/AntonyCorbett/OnlyR/releases/latest) file (there is also a portable version if you'd prefer to just copy a folder). 
If you choose the portable option, you may also need to download and install the Microsoft .NET 5.0 Desktop runtime (x86) from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).

If you want the NET6 version, you can download this repo and build it yourself.  You may also need to download and install the Microsoft .NET 6.0 Desktop runtime (x86) from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime).
